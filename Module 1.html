        <p> Simply put, cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, 
           <br>storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet 
            <br> (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.
        </p>

        <p> You typically pay only for cloud services you use, helping you lower
             lower your operating costs, run your infrastructure more efficiently, 
           and scale as your business needs change.
        </p>

        <p>Cloud computing is a tool that enables convenient and on-demand network access 
            <br> to a large pool of systems that is connected through public or private networks which 
             <br> provides dynamic infrastructure for applications and data storage”. The codes of an open-source
             <br>software is available for anyone one to use, make changes and also amend to suit a user’s needs.
            Cloud computing means that instead of all the computer hardware and 
            software you're using sitting on your desktop, or somewhere inside your 
            company's network, it's provided for you as a service by another company
             and accessed over the Internet, usually in a completely seamless
              way. Exactly where the hardware and software is located and how 
              it all works doesn't matter to you, the user—it's just somewhere up
               in the nebulous "cloud" that the Internet represents.
