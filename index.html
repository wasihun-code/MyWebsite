        <p> Simply put, cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, 
           <br>storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet 
            <br> (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.
        </p>

        <p> You typically pay only for cloud services you use, helping you 
            <br> lower your operating costs, run your infrastructure more efficiently, 
             <br> and scale as your business needs change.
        </p>

        <p>Cloud computing is a tool that enables convenient and on-demand network access 
            <br> to a large pool of systems that is connected through public or private networks which 
             <br> provides dynamic infrastructure for applications and data storage”. The codes of an open-source
             <br>software is available for anyone one to use, make changes and also amend to suit a user’s needs.
