                <h1 class = "Discription"> There are three primary types of services offered in cloud computing  </h1>
            <p> Software-as-a-Service (SaaS):  useful productivity applications are offered to cloud users at a fee 
                over the Internet. Cloud users do not have to worry about installation and licenses and the application 
                can be accessed anytime anywhere using suitable devices. 
                <br> 2.	Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)
               <br> mthe cloud user has the opportunity of leveraging on the CSP platform to create and deploy custom applications. 
                 The user has control over his application and the operating system while the CSP controls of the underlying infrastructure. 
                <br> 3.Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS): In IaaS, the CSP provides compute resource and storage capacity, such CSPs
                have large infrastructure spread across different geographical locations. The user has control over the compute resource
                and storage including any deployed application, while the CSP has control over the core infrastructure.
