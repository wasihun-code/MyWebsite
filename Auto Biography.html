            <p> My name is Wasihun ageru.I was born in march 3, 1992 on Monday. I completed 
               <br> my kindergarten school in golder age school. I learnt from grade one to 
                <br> grade ten in cisterician monastry mariam tsion school. I completed my preparatory
                 <br> educational level in Bole preparatory and Secondary school. I scored a good mark
                 <br> in Universty entrance examination. I joined Addis Ababa university because my grade
                 <br> was satisfactory and it satisfies the requirement of the university. Currently I am
                <br> student in Ethiopian Institute of architecture and construction. My Learning
                <br> carreer was amazing. I used to hate learning when I was child. But Now I love 
                <br> learning due to Ideological change. During My childhood I used to spent my time
                <br> with my friends playing football. I like coding a lot. I started to code when 
                <br> I was a highschool student.
